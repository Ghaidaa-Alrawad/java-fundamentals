# JavaScript Linter App

The JavaScript Linter App is a Java program designed to analyze JavaScript code files and identify missing semicolons. It reads JavaScript files, checks for lines without semicolons, and provides error messages for each occurrence. The app excludes certain lines from analysis, such as empty lines and lines containing control flow statements like "if" and "else". It offers a straightforward way to enhance code quality by detecting and reporting missing semicolons in JavaScript code.
