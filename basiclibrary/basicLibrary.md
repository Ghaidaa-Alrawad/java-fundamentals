# Lab 02 Basic Library

This Java program, named "basiclibray", provides implementations for several basic tasks involving arrays. It includes methods to simulate dice rolls, check for duplicates in an array, calculate averages of arrays, and find the array with the lowest average from an array of arrays

1. **Rolling Dice Task**: The method roll(n) simulates rolling a six-sided dice n times and returns an array containing the values of the rolls.

2. **Contains Duplicates Task**: The method containsDuplicates(array) checks whether an array contains duplicate values and returns true if duplicates are found, otherwise false.

3. **Calculating Averages Task**: The method calculateAverage(array) calculates and returns the average of integer values in an array.

4. **Arrays of Arrays Task**: The method calculateLowestAverage(arrays) calculates the average for each array within an array of arrays and returns the array with the lowest average.

# Lab 03 Basic Library

We continue to work on the same java program, in this lab03 in the MapAndTally java file i've implemented 2 new methods as the lab03 required: 

1. **Analyze Weather Task**: This method calculates the minimum and maximum temperatures, identifies unique temperatures, and lists any missing temperatures within the given range.

2. **Tally Task**: This method utilizes a Map to count the votes for each candidate and determines the candidate with the highest number of votes, declaring them as the winner.
