# Lab 02 Basic Library

This Java program, named "Library," provides implementations for several basic tasks involving arrays. It includes methods to simulate dice rolls, check for duplicates in an array, calculate averages of arrays, and find the array with the lowest average from an array of arrays

1. **Rolling Dice Task**: The method roll(n) simulates rolling a six-sided dice n times and returns an array containing the values of the rolls.

2. **Contains Duplicates Task**: The method containsDuplicates(array) checks whether an array contains duplicate values and returns true if duplicates are found, otherwise false.

3. **Calculating Averages Task**: The method calculateAverage(array) calculates and returns the average of integer values in an array.

4. **Arrays of Arrays Task**: The method calculateLowestAverage(arrays) calculates the average for each array within an array of arrays and returns the array with the lowest average.
